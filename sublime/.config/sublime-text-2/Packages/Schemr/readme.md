# User Settings
These settings are available to control some of Schemr's behaviour. Add them to `Preferences.sublime-settings` if you wish to override the default value.

`schemr_brightness_threshold`: Integer 0-255. Defaults to 100.

The brightness theshold setting allows you to define where the cutoff occurs between Dark and Light themes. Higher values indicate increasing brightess approaching white rgb(255, 255, 255), while lower values indicate decreasing brightess approaching black rgb(0, 0, 0).

`schemr_brightness_flags`: Boolean true|false. Defaults to true.

The brightness flags setting allows you to disable the "[Dark]" or "[Light]" text that appears after the scheme name in the quick panel. Disabling this will turn off colour scheme parsing entirely and may increase performance if you have a large number of schemes.

`schemr_preview_selection`: Boolean true|false. Defaults to true.

If you are using Sublime Text 3, you can enable/disable previewing the highlighted colour scheme as you move up/down through the list if you don't like the preview functionality or experience performance issues.

# Note about [SublimeLinter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter)

To improve the user experience, Schemr filters schemes that contain `(SL)` from being listed or activated with Schemr commands. These schemes can still be enabled manually through the application menu or user settings file.

If a colour scheme does not define colours for the [SublimeLinter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter) plugin, it will be extended and the updated scheme written to a file with `(SL)` appended to the name. If you have a lot of schemes and switch between them frequently this can quickly pollute the scheme list with many duplicates. You only need to activate the base colour scheme and SublimeLinter will switch to the `(SL)` version automatically.
