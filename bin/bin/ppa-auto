# A script to automate the downloading and building of a from a PPA.
# While direct downloads from PPAs can be troublesome on Debian
# due to "binary incompatibility", building the package from source
# will (help) ensure system compatibility. By using the source code 
# from the PPA repo instead of the upstream source code, all the hard work
# of building a Debian package is already done, and you can reap the 
# advantages of using APT to handle dependencies etc.

# This script is currently not very smart. There are 3 mandatory args,
# and some research must be done to find them.

usage(){
    cat <<EOF
    
    Usage: ppa-auto <ppa> <release> <key> <package>

    <ppa> must be in the form of ppa:xx/yy (or just xx/yy)

    <release> is an ubuntu release, e.g., trusty, precise. It doesn't matter too much which one you use, but it is mandatory. 
    My advice, as of June 2014:
     Debian Squeeze: lucid
     Debian Wheezy: quantal
     Debian Jessie/testing: trusty, otherwise the latest available
     Debian Sid: trusty, otherwise the latest available
     Debian experimental (are you crazy?): utopic, otherwise the latest available

    <key> must be viewed on the launchpad page for the ppa. It is the 8-digit hexadecimal "signing key". Omit the "1024R/".

    <package> is the actual package to be downloaded.
